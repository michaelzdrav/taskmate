# TaskMate
Heres a basic to do list to keep you accountable of your tasks. Simply register your own user, create a task with a title, due date and description. Each task can have comments made.

When your task is overdue, you will see an "Overdue" message displayed, along with an increment of the overdue task counter in the UI. Once completed, move the task to Done. Otherwise, Delete the task to be lost forever.

Please make sure to remove the <b>test</b> user in <b>web/db.py</b> if you are going to expose this to the Internet.

## Dependencies
- Make sure you have sqlite3 installed locally

## Setup
Initialise the database and virtual environment.

## Building the Docker image
Run with the ```Makefile```
```bash

## Docker

#### Run with docker-compose (development environment)

```bash

## Roadmap 
Order depends on what I feel like working on when I have the free time ðŸ˜ƒ

- ~~CI/CD pipeline to build image and push to Dockerhub~~

  - Flask-paranoid
  - ~~Password Reset~~
  - ~~Password complexity~~
  - ~~Account verification~~ (using Twilio Verify)




# Contribution

**Live app link: [On render](https://taskmate-x765.onrender.com)**

These are some of the suggested contributions to **TaskMate**:

- Refactor code to use the concept of separation of concerns (each functionality resides as a stand-alond module)
  - Config module
  - DB Schema
  - Email
  - Application instance
  - Forms (using bootstrap to quicky generate and style them)
  - Migrations (all changes to db schema available for review)
- Modify the design of the database to support any engine
  - The default is SQLite (it is small, quick to setup, does not require a server)
  - If another is needed, then you can pass that as an environment variable in `.env`
- Application instance:
  - Refactored the factory function `create_app()` to not only initialize the extention variables but also to log errors (1. On file and 2. Send log data to admin via email)
- To ensure the emailing feature works all the time, locally and on a prod app, I have used Twilio Sendgrid (You will have to create your own accounts with Twilio and Sengrid. It is free.)
- All static resources are put in individual files as seen in the static folder
- Base template modified to truly make it a base that child templates find reusable elements only.


## UI Updates are as seen below:

### Email Reminders

With the **threaded** email functionality in place, email reminders can be sent to a user to remind them of overdue tasks. The best approach to this would be to use cronjobs, a built-in utility in Linux. What will happen when this feature is completed is that at set intervals, say daily, an email reminder will be sent to each user in the database reminding them of ALL their overdue tasks.

To make it possible, I have added the following:
- Email template (see `overdue_task_email_notification` in [email module](/app/email.py))
- Task reminder (see `send_overdue_task_reminder` in [task reminder module](/app/task_reminders.py))
- Custom CLI commands (see `register` in [CLI module](/app/cli.py))
- Register the custom CLI commands in [main module](main.py)
- To implement cronjobs in Flask, check out [this tutorial](https://www.gitauharrison.com/articles/cronjobs-in-flask#scheduling).

Unfortunately, the live app on render does not have the cronjob utility feature setup (it is a paid service which is not necessary in the scope of this application).

## Testing Locally

- Clone this repo:

  ```python
  $ git clone git@github.com:GitauHarrison/taskmate.git
  ```

- Change folder to the cloned directory:

  ```python
  $ cd taskmate
  ```

- Activate virtual environment:

  ```python
  # Default way
  $ python3 -m venv venv
  $ source venv/bin/activate

  # Using virtualenvwrapper
  $ mkvirtualenv venv
  ```

- Install dependances needed:

  ```python
  (venv)$ pip3 install -r requirements.txt
  ```

- Add needed environment variables:

  ```python
  (venv) cp .env-template .env # Add values to the .env file
  ```

- Start flask server:

  ```python
  (venv)$ flask run
  ```

- Copy and paste localhost link in your favourite browser
